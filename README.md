- **Revenue and Sales Analysis:** Calculate total and monthly revenue, top brands by sales, and product stock levels.
- **Customer Behavior Insights:** Analyze average customer ratings, return rates by brand, season, and category.
- **Inventory and Pricing Trends:** Evaluate markdown impacts, stock quantities, and pricing trends by category and brand.
- **Advanced Aggregation & Filtering:** Use grouping, HAVING clauses, and date formatting for time-based analysis.
